<p>Hi,</p>

<p>My name is Piero. </p>

<p>I am an expert in web applications and web accessibility. I have developed this expertise by working with start-ups to revamp their web platforms, accessibility advocates to flesh out major projects and demos, and teaching aspiring developers how to code at Austin Coding Academy.</p>

<p>You will like working with me because I over communicate to a fault, I charge a reasonable rate in exchange for the value I deliver, and I guarantee I will get the job done.</p>
