<i>Our guest blogger is Emily Hollen, SFA Geography Major.</i><br /></div><br>
<br /><br />
<div style="text-align: left;">
Why do we come to college? To get the degree right? So we can get that job we want, make money, support our family and live happily ever after. While all of this is true and are fantastic reasons to go to college, we shouldn’t lose track of what else college has to offer.
<br /><br />
Here are 4 things you can do to get the most out of  your college experience:
<br /><br />
1) Be where you are.
<br /><br />
When you’re in college, you are probably stuck in same city for the next 2-5 years. For most students it's just a pit stop. 
<br /><br />
I go to school in Nacogdoches, Texas. For a while, I spent most of my time here dreaming and planning for the future, knowing that I would probably never come back to East Texas. I still plan for the future and dream about my next location, but over time I’ve learned to enjoy where I am. I don’t want to look back on college and only remember the classroom. I rather remember brunch at the Liberty bell, two-steppin’ at Banita Creek Dance Hall, the sweet sweet old lady at downtown arts that helped me with all my shirt needs, and last but not least, the times spent alone (most likely in a hammock) on the many trails of Nac enjoying the beautiful nature of East Texas. 
<br /><br />
2) Utilize your professors.
<br /><br />
Some professors just come to campus to teach, work on their research and/or projects, and then go home. Not all professors but it’s true. However, if you find a professor that does care they want nothing more than to help you do your very best. I’ve been lucky. I have two great professors that I see multiple times a week, ask about my life, and truly want me to be the very best. Honestly, I cannot tell you if I would be where I am today without them. I was in college to get the degree and get out so I could “start my life”. Then what seemed like out of no where I had these two professors pushing me, tell me to research on my own, do extra readings, entering me into conferences to present my work, etc. Through having them there I have accomplished more in the past semester then I did my whole first year of college. I have grown to love my field, took on a second major, and am on my way to two national level conferences to present my personal research. So find a professor and ask them for more, I promise you there are professors out there that are just waiting for a student to want more. 
<br /><br />
3) Learn for the sake of learning.
<br /><br />
Everyone for the most part needs electives. So take a class that looks interesting to you. Learn a language just because you love the country it’s spoken in, take Bowling because you’ve always wanted to bowl a strike, or art because your living room needs a new picture. Whatever it may be just find a class that teaches you something you’ve always wanted to learn about. Also, in the classes that are required really learn the material. You may find out a useful knowledge that will surprise you or show up later in your career. You are paying GOOD money, so you might as well get everything you can out of that class. 
<br /><br />
4) Push yourself.
<br /><br />
One of my teachers constantly say “crap in crap out”. I have taken this motto into my life. The ideas, work, effort I put into my college experience is what I will get out of it. I could just go to class get good grades then graduate and leave. Instead, I can push myself. Aim for goals that might seem crazy at the beginning, if you don’t try then how can you know. This goes for being involved, I go to church, work, president of a club, attend conferences, and also go to school. Somedays its too much, but most of the times everything pays off. I have learned so much though doing all this, it has made me a better person!
