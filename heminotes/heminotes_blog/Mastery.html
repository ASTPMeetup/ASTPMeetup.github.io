<i>Our guest blogger is Alan Smith, the 2012 Valedictorian of Rice University. Here's what he had to say about mastering college..</i><br /></div><br>
<br />
<div style="text-align: left;">
<b>1) The Importance of Strategy: Understand the System&nbsp;</b></div>
<br />
&nbsp;The credential system of a college isn't always a perfect indicator of an individual's true knowledge and understanding. Assisted by forethought and strategy, <b>the key to getting good grades is simple: meet your professors' expectations</b>. In many classes, the smartest kids, in some of my experiences, didn't get the highest grades. They weren't attuned with what the professor wanted. One time, my friend had elaborately and tirelessly studied the textbook; however, I was shocked because I knew the professor was almost chiefly interested in testing his lectures. Other times, my peers were really interested in the topic but didn't focus on the particulars of what the professor thought was important.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Classes can be very different and each requires crafting a new strategy and approach. As amazing resources, your professors have dedicated a large portion of their lives to a field of study. As an active student in and after class, you should develop relationships with your professors to learn from them; you must understand how a professor thinks about the subject and how he constructs his course. Importantly, you need go to every class to hear the focus of the lectures, the particulars of every assignment, and the key clues to know what is expected of you. You can also ask students who have taken classes by the professor or you can read internet reviews to form a great approach to the class.<br />
<br />
<b>2) Put Time On Your Side</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp;Almost every student has felt that time is their enemy. When you're sinking with homework, the ticks on a clock can feel like being in a room with the walls closing in on you. Time is a tyrant that marches forward despite what our needs demand. However, an effective mastery of time will allow you to become the best student you can be and makes life seem relatively easy.<br />
<br />
While the infamous practice of “cramming” has been universally condemned, there may be less obvious reasons why the technique is so bad. It is scientifically proven that our best ideas come when we're in a relaxed state of mind. Additionally, with effective time management, we allow more time for our subconscious to process information and make connections. When we introduce problems in a relaxed time frame, our brains are learning and studying even if we're not at the library desk with open books. This is why some of my best academic ideas came while socializing with others, taking a shower, or even dreaming. However, if we wait to the last moment to study or write a paper, the stressed, cramped atmosphere will not allow our brains to work at the highest level. Indeed, most of my greatest ideas would not have been born.<br />
<br />
Cramming is the antithesis of learning. To truly learn and master a topic, the essential ingredients are ample time and repeated exposure to the material: spaced repetition. If you can study well before a test, even a small time allotted each day to studying inculcates the material into your mind and cements knowledge; the topic can become second nature. If you actually want to develop knowledge and remember what you learned for life outside the classroom, you must adopt spaced repetition and reject short-sighted, ineffective cramming sessions.<br />
<br />
<b>3) Have a Passion for Learning</b><br />
<br />
As we go about our day, we walk on the side of big rock that we call earth. However, dwarfed by the black abyss of space, this planet's size in relation to the whole universe is like a grain of sand on a seashore. Indeed, why does anything exist at all? Would it be possible that nothing could have existed? I ask these question using the English language that somehow evolved to allow us to communicate with each other. How does our brains function and process this language and adjudicate truth claims? With these questions and others, we can see that the world is a deeply fascinating place filled with complex mechanisms and mystery. The educational enterprise is about illuminating and exploring all the facets of existence. To have a passion for learning, you are not satisfied to allow these mysteries and knowledge that we have gained as humans to go unexplored. As Socrates said, the unexamined life is not worth living.<br />
<br />
All the best students have an intrinsic awe about the world and a desire to know. Educational researchers have found that our attitude about studying matters almost as much as how we study. As you go about your studies, you must approach it positively and realize that this is the time in your life that you can ask the big questions and search for interesting knowledge about the world around you. While college can be stressful and busy, never let the spark for knowledge dim in the quest to become an educated individual who develops his own opinion about life.
